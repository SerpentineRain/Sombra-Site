This is more or less a site dedicated to Sombra,  a character from the Blizzard game known as Overwatch. I hope to eventually make this into a website which manages a web page for each character, including things such as patch notes, a database for skins and other collectables, strengths and weaknesses in enemy counters, and so on. I hope to use my knowledge of digital design to create an involved and personal artistic style for each hero's page using symbols and color schemes that best represent them. For now, I find it most appropriate to begin with Sombra!
